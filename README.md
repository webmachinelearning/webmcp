# Web Model Context API ðŸ§ª

This is a repository for the [Web Machine Learning Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webmachinelearning/) ([join](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/community/#join)) to continue discussion on the [Web Model Context API proposal](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/proposals/issues/12).

## Scope of Work

This repository hosts discussions ([issues](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmodelcontext/issues)) and any [non-normative reports](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/charter/#non-normative-reports) such as use cases, requirements, and explainers.

Work on formal specifications informed by discussions in this repository require a [charter change](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/charter/#charter-change). We expect to advance to this more formal spec authoring phase in the near future.

## Code of Conduct

The Web Machine Learning Community Group operates under the [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).
